DESCRIPTION

Haskell bindings to ReviewBoard (http://code.google.com/p/reviewboard/)

From the ReviewBoard project page:
"Review Board is a web-based tool designed to help projects and companies 
 keep track of pending code changes and make code reviews much less painful
 and time-consuming..."

This package contains:
- The WebAPI binding to ReviewBoard.
- Sample command line tools mkrr and rbpatch demonstrating the usage 
  of the bindings. 
  -  Using 'mkrr' new review requests can be submitted 
     from the local repository copy as simple as:
        svn diff | mkrr -r [reviewers]
  - 'rbpatch' applies patches to local repository from a review request diff.
  For details see the tools haddock documentation.

Implemented and tested using ReviewBoard 1.0 Beta (4/25/2008).
